## How to Use This Documentation

### For Learning
- Start with `project-evolution.md` to understand the project timeline
- Read architecture documents to understand design patterns
- Review challenges to learn from problems and solutions

### For Development
- Use templates when adding new features
- Update relevant docs when making changes
- Document new challenges and their solutions

### For Maintenance
- Check feature docs before modifying existing functionality
- Review architecture docs before making structural changes
- Update documentation as part of your development process

## Documentation Principles

1. **Living Documentation**: Update docs with code changes
2. **Context Preservation**: Explain WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT
3. **Problem-Solution Pairing**: Document challenges alongside their solutions
4. **Evolution Tracking**: Show how the project grew organically
5. **Future Reference**: Write for your future self who forgot the context
